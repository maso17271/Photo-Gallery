# Photo-Gallery

A vanilla JS photo gallery using the Unsplash API
to generate photos based on user input.
Needs an access key from Unsplash to function.

In order to get the gallery to function, add the access key to the accessKey variable within the script.js file.
This will allow the gallery to make search queries based on input to a search form and fetch images from Unsplash API with a brief description,
author name and hyper-link to original image.
